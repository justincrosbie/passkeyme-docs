## Why Passkeys Are Important and the Problems They Solve

### Introduction

In today's digital age, security is a top priority for both users and developers. Traditional authentication methods, such as passwords, have been the cornerstone of online security for decades. However, they come with significant drawbacks. Passkeys, a modern alternative to passwords, offer a solution to many of these issues. In this blog post, we'll explore why passkeys are important and the problems they solve.

### The Problem with Passwords

Passwords have long been the go-to method for securing online accounts, but they have several inherent flaws:

1. **Weak Passwords**: Many users choose simple, easily guessable passwords, making their accounts vulnerable to attacks.
2. **Password Reuse**: Users often reuse passwords across multiple sites. If one site is compromised, all accounts using that password are at risk.
3. **Phishing Attacks**: Phishing attacks trick users into revealing their passwords to malicious actors, leading to account breaches.
4. **Credential Stuffing**: Automated attacks use stolen username-password pairs to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
5. **Management Overhead**: Users need to remember numerous passwords, leading to poor password practices and a reliance on insecure storage methods.

### Enter Passkeys

Passkeys leverage public-key cryptography to provide a more secure and user-friendly authentication method. Here's how they work and the problems they solve:

1. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Passkeys use asymmetric cryptography, generating a unique public-private key pair for each service. The private key never leaves the user's device, while the public key is stored on the server.
   - This method ensures that even if a server is compromised, the user's private key remains secure.

2. **Phishing Resistance**:
   - Passkeys are inherently resistant to phishing attacks. Since the private key never leaves the user's device, attackers cannot steal it through phishing attempts.

3. **Elimination of Password Reuse**:
   - Each service generates a unique key pair, eliminating the risk associated with password reuse. Compromising one service does not jeopardize others.

4. **Simplified User Experience**:
   - Passkeys simplify the login process. Users no longer need to remember complex passwords or use password managers. Authentication can be as simple as using a biometric scanner or entering a PIN.

5. **Protection Against Credential Stuffing**:
   - Passkeys render credential stuffing attacks ineffective. Since there are no shared passwords to exploit, attackers cannot use stolen credentials across multiple sites.
